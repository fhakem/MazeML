# MazeML
Solve mazes using reinforcement learning techniques
Our project provides a straightforward implementation of Q-learning, a popular reinforcement learning algorithm, to navigate through mazes of varying complexity. With a user-friendly interface and clear documentation, you can easily test and compare different hyperparameters, and observe the agent's learning progress as it finds its way through the maze.
